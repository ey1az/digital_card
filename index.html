            <h3>Education and Focus</h3>
            <p>
                I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Information Technology, holding a GPA of 3.0+. My current focus is on
                advancing my expertise in Linux system administration by completing all required objectives of the RHCSA (Red Hat
                Certified System Administrator). With a strong foundation in network management and security, I continue to build
                hands-on skills that support my goal of becoming a professional Linux system administrator.
            </p>
            <h3>Projects and Experience</h3>
            <p>
                I have worked on a variety of <a id=a1 href="https://github.com/ey1az" target="_blank">projects</a> related to web development, 
                data analytics, network configuration, digital logic
                design, and more. These experiences have allowed me to apply my technical skills in real-world scenarios, develop
                problem-solving abilities, and enhance my understanding of various IT domains. My recent efforts have also included
                system administration labs and tasks aligned with RHCSA objectives using Linux-based environments.
            </p>
            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
            <p>
                I possess proficiency in Microsoft Office Suite and have hands-on experience with technologies such as HTML/CSS, Python,
                Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot, Gradle, React, GitHub, PostgreSQL, Spark, Hadoop MapReduce, and more. With a strong
                interest in network management and system security, I have practical experience using Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, and
                Virtual Machines. Currently, I am deepening my skills in Linux administration using Rocky Linux and related tools as I
                work toward RHCSA-level competency.
